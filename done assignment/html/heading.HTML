    <h1>HTML_Paragraphs</h1>
    <!--HTML Paragraphs-->
    <p>we will know the HTML Paragraph, & its basic implementation through the examples. The
        tag in HTML defines a paragraph. These have both opening and closing tags. So anything mentioned within
        and is treated as a paragraph. Most browsers read a line as a paragraph even if we donâ€™t use the closing
        tag i.e, but this may raise unexpected results. So, it is both a good convention, and we must use the closing
        tag. </p>
